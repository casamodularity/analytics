## Modularity Smart Home Analytics

### Inspiration

- AAL Research - Active Assisted Live http://www.aal-europe.eu/
- Living Analytics Research Center https://larc.smu.edu.sg/

### What it does

It monitors in real time different aspects of smart living solutions (data from sensors and connected devices) in order to understand human behaviour and to automate repetitive and time consuming tasks.

### How we built it

Using Qlik Sense Desktop Edition and connecting and generating sample data and using statistical data that are existing on the internet.

It also connects live data from a smart metering solution to a DB2 database from where it takes data.

### Challenges we ran into
InnoEnergy - How to empower Public Authorities to support innovation ecosystem in order to promote entrepreneurship.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We've connected the smart metering solution to the Node-RUN service from IBM and we are proud that we've developed a working prototype in order to be soon ready to get real data to analyse human behaviour.

### What we learned
By analysing data in real time we are able to learn and understand what is important for people and also how it can be optimised the energy consume.

### What's next for Smart Living Analytics
Changing the structure of the software architecture by adding NoSQL support (MongoDB) in order to get all data from a single source (not hybrid sources as we do right now).

Also making available to web.

### Built With
qlik
sql
node-red

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/casamodularity/analytics/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.


## #Local authorities

- we try to convince local authorities to use latest technologies in order to facilitate the connection with smart buildings
- convince authorities to give access to open data (this is a right not a service)
